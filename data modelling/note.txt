//Data Modelling
Data modelling is the process of creating blueprint of a systemâ€™s data, what and how it will be stored, accessed, and related. It helps define the structure, relationships, constraints, and operations that can be performed on the data.

in simpler terms, it answers the question 
"what kind of data do we want, have and how do we organize it?"
